# We use this knowledge to add the following columns:
# - age_diff shows how much each person has aged since their first checkup.

# - observed_for shows how many years of observation are left until the censoring date.
# We also drop X since it just counts rows.

# The following expression shows how many examinations were done roughly how
# many years after each person's first checkup. Note that this is not the
# same as calendar years since the first observation.
# The checkups are approimately 6 years apart, so it seems reasonable that
# the one observation after 8 years would belong to the second checkup round,
# while the three checkups after ten years would belong to the third. This way, each
# checkup round runs over a consecutive number of years (as measured by age_diff).
